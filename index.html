                <strong>modeling the path of particles in magnetic fields (my current project)</strong>
                <p>i really enjoy learning plasma physics, so i'm learning to build my own algorithms <br>
                    that can model the path of charged particles in various magnetic field configs</p>

                <strong>learning Buddhist philosophy</strong>
                <p>had an interesting dicussion about Buddhism recently, and now i'm working on developing my inner <br>
                    harmony so that my happiness isn't reliant on external circumatsnaces</p>

                <strong>challening the human limits</strong>
                <p>our evolution has coddled our minds to always optimize for whats comfortable and easy, it's a <br>
                    survial instict that places a HUGE limiter on how hard we can push ourselves physically. rn, i'm pushing <br>
                    myself with so that i can find where my true limits are.</p>

                <strong>using experiments for personal growth</strong>
                <p>recently, i had the realization that intense growth comes only from experiencing failure. the question of "how?" is <br>
                    dangerous, and it fools us to think growth can be obtained from others experience. so i'm forgetting the "how?", and focusing <br>
                    solely on experimentation. i share these experiments in my newsletter "LabRats".</p>

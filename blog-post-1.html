    <p>Have you ever wondered what life would be like if our brains were computers? Oh, all the things we could do. Everyone would be walking around like a terminator. Well, 
        wake up. Your brain is a computer. Comprised of more than 80 billion neurons, your neural network is vast and largely unexplored. We don't understand how it works, only 
        the causality of the things it spits out. We know if given x, it'll spit out y. But not the functions that made x equal y. Within all this complexity is a method of utilizing 
        all your brain's subconscious understanding without needing to understand it yourself. I call it "the art of not thinking." You see, when you think, you disrupt the process of 
        your brain. Because you're utilizing your mitochondria, the part of our brain that can only hold such little data at once. And data = quality, so with every decision you should 
        optimize to make that decision at the point of maximum data and insight. Typically, the point where we have the most data on a potential decision is the latest possible 
        point that a decision can be made. By making decisions at the latest possible moment, you're optimizing to make the best possible decision. That's why last-minute choices 
        are actually the best, given there are no repercussions that disagree with that. This is the trick to stop thinking and to utilize the other 75% of your brain that makes 
        up your subconscious. Now, for more minor decisions like "Do I feel like going for a walk?" or "What do I wanna eat right now?" the time frame to make that decision is 
        usually the moment you pose the question. 
        <br><br>
        After experimenting, making decisions without thinking leads to overall better outcomes. That's vs making decisions based on 
        rigorous thinking and pondering over the data. When you tie it back to what I said earlier, it's obvious why this is true. Trying to think rigorously about a decision 
        is utilizing the part of my brain (the mitochondria) that can merely analyze a few data points. Instead, by not thinking, you're utilizing the vast processing 
        power that makes up other parts of your brain. Now, if you're going to practice the art of not thinking, you must exercise a stoic mindset. One stoic to the uncertain 
        outcomes will be satisfied regardless of which outcome is produced. This is called the philosophy of indifference. By being indifferent to various outcomes, you're setting 
        yourself up to avoid dissatisfaction when expectations don't meet reality.
